# Humerus

An ARM instruction disassembler written in C#

## Questions you might ask

### What can it do?

It can disassemble all ARM mode instructions up to ARMv7 (excluding Advanced SIMD and VFP instructions).

### Why only ARM instructions?

It was a submission for a course assignment. I didn't have time to add support for Thumb-1, Thumb-2, Thumb-EE or any extensions. I may implement them at some point.

### Why C#?

As I said, it was a course assignment and both C++ and Rust were not languages I was able to choose for the assignment, so I went with C#.

### Why is \<thing\> not optimal?

Course assignment. No time.

### How come \<x\>, \<y\> â€¦ are not done?

Course assignment.

### Wow, I really hate you for using an arm bone as the name of an ARM project, you know that?

Same
